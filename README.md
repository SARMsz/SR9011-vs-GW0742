<h1>SR9011 vs GW0742: My Honest Review After Testing Both</h1>

<p>When it comes to endurance SARMs and fat burners, <strong>SR9011</strong> and <strong>GW0742</strong> are two names that keep popping up. Iâ€™ve run both in separate cutting cycles and tracked everythingâ€”energy, cardio performance, fat loss, sleep, and recovery. If you're stuck choosing between them, here's everything you need to know from real use.</p>

<h2>How I Tested These Two SARMs</h2>
<p>I ran SR9011 and GW0742 on separate 6-week cycles. Diet and training stayed the same. I tracked:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cardio stamina (measured with HIIT and 5K runs)</li>
  <li>Body fat percentage (measured weekly)</li>
  <li>Recovery and sleep quality</li>
  <li>Side effects like mood, sleep issues, and energy crash</li>
</ul>
<p>No stacks, no other compoundsâ€”just straight SR9011 and GW0742 solo, one at a time.</p>

<h2>What Is SR9011?</h2>
<p><strong>SR9011</strong> is a Rev-ErbA agonist, not technically a SARM but often grouped with them. It affects your circadian rhythm and metabolic rate. It's designed to mimic the effects of endurance training. I used <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/sr9011/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SR9011 from Chemyo</a>.</p>

<h3>My SR9011 Results</h3>
<p>Within 3 days, I noticed better endurance during cardio. It felt like I could run forever. Resting heart rate dropped a few points. Fat started coming off by the second weekâ€”especially around the waist.</p>
<p>However, the timing was tricky. You need to dose this before workouts (1-2 hours pre-workout) or the effects fade fast.</p>

<h3>SR9011 Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Massive increase in endurance</li>
  <li>Noticeable fat loss in weeks 2â€“6</li>
  <li>No testosterone suppression</li>
  <li>No PCT required</li>
</ul>

<h3>SR9011 Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Short half-life (multiple daily doses recommended)</li>
  <li>Can mess with sleep if taken too late</li>
  <li>No real muscle-building effects</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Best for:</strong> Endurance athletes, cutting cycles, cardio-heavy training</h4>

<h2>What Is GW0742?</h2>
<p><strong>GW0742</strong> is a second-generation PPARÎ´ agonist, similar to Cardarine (GW501516) but with stronger binding. It boosts fat oxidation, enhances energy output, and improves muscular endurance. I used <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/gw0742/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GW0742 from Chemyo</a>.</p>

<h3>My GW0742 Results</h3>
<p>This one came on slower than SR9011 but felt smoother overall. By week 2, I noticed a steady increase in cardio performance. It helped me go longer in the gym and recover faster between sets. I dropped about 5 lbs of fat without changing diet much.</p>
<p>Also, I didnâ€™t have to time it perfectly like SR9011. Once a day was enough.</p>

<h3>GW0742 Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Boosts fat metabolism efficiently</li>
  <li>Stable energy without crashes</li>
  <li>Enhances cardio performance and recovery</li>
  <li>Once-a-day dosing</li>
</ul>

<h3>GW0742 Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Not as fast-acting as SR9011</li>
  <li>Still in early researchâ€”less human data</li>
  <li>No muscle-building effects</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Best for:</strong> Cutting, long cardio sessions, weight loss phases</h4>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>SR9011 and GW0742 are both top-tier tools for endurance and fat lossâ€”but theyâ€™re not the same. If you want fast results and can manage multiple daily doses, grab <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/sr9011/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SR9011 here</a>. If you prefer steady energy and one dose a day, <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/gw0742/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GW0742 is the better option</a>.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve used bothâ€”and they both work. Just depends on your goals and lifestyle.</p>
